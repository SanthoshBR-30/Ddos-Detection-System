# Ddos-Detection-System


## Overview
This project is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) detection system implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It analyzes network traffic patterns to identify potential DDoS attacks using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for network traffic.
- Machine learning models to classify normal and attack traffic.
- Visualization of network traffic for better understanding.
- Performance evaluation metrics for model accuracy.

## Installation
   git clone https://github.com/SanthoshBR-30/Ddos-Detection-System.git
